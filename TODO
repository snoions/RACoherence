1. Add flushes
2. Write perf tests, need to consider the following factors that affects concurrency/contention:
    a. addr range, affects contention on CacheLineTracker 
    b. buffer size, affects contention on LogBuffer concurrecny
    c. ratio of load/store and atomic/non-atomic, affects contention on clocks
4. Eval using a CXL simulator.
